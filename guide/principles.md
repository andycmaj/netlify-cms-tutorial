* automate everything
* coding standards and styles are only rules if enforced in the build. static analysis or it didn't happen
* everything is code
* pick the right tool, but prefer a well known tool
* fix a bug, add a test
* you own entire application including all ops
* decisions must be evidence based so moar metrics is always better
* atomic changes/merge requests
